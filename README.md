# Energy Market Resilience Metrics

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis and metric framework for assessing resilience in energy markets. It focuses on quantifying market disruptions and system responses through data-driven methods and visualization.

## Overview

The notebook **Energy_Market_Resilience_Metrics.ipynb** explores the dynamics of energy market performance under varying conditions and introduces resilience metrics to evaluate:

- Price deviations during shocks
- Recovery times post-disturbance
- System volatility
- Energy supply consistency

These metrics are designed to help policymakers, analysts, and researchers better understand and improve energy market robustness in the face of disruptions, such as extreme weather events, demand surges, or supply shortages.

## Features

- 📊 **Visualization of Market Dynamics**: Time series plots illustrating price behavior and system performance before, during, and after disturbances.
- 🧮 **Resilience Metric Calculations**: Functions and formulas for computing key metrics like deviation area, maximum deviation, recovery duration, and rate.
- ⚙️ **Modular Structure**: Code organized for easy adaptation to other datasets or energy systems.
- 📁 **Example Dataset**: Simulated or real-world energy market data (load, price, etc.) used to demonstrate methodology.

## Use Cases

- Benchmarking grid and market performance
- Policy assessment for resilience planning
- Academic research in energy economics and systems
- Supporting investment and risk assessment models
